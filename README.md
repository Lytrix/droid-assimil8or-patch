# droid-assimil8or-patch
This Droid patch creates 4 sequencers.
- 2 Drum slice sequencers for slicing and sequencing a 1 bar drum loop on Assimil8or using a M4.
- One 16 step Sequencer like the Verbos Multistage with an additional CV track ALT_CV
- One 4 polyphony midi sequencer.

 
The Drum slice sequencers provides 8/16/32 slices (selectable via a switch) of a 1 bar drumloop using the M4 notches to select a sample start for each of the 16 steps and additionally the rand cv, gate prob, ratchets, velocity, pitch and timing for creating grooves on 4 repeating 16th clock ticks.

Using the MENU you can record 2 faders: autoreset and pattern changes on the fly by hitting record and selecting the length of the recording with the rotary knob.

Each sequencer has 4 presets where a sequence can be stored in.

When you hit record, you can record your button switches between presets using the record.

You can switch between the sequence or manual mode, similar as the ER101.
